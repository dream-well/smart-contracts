# Smart contracts on Solana

This project demonstrates how smart contracts work on the [Solana](https://solana.com) blockchain.

Solana is a high performance modern blockchain with impressive throughput capabilities. It can handle 50,000 transactions per second which makes it scalable and fast enough to enable a new era of decentralised applications (dApps).

## What are the pros and cons of building smart contracts on Solana?

Solana has implemented eight different key technologies that are essential for its existence. One of those is called Sealevel, which makes parallel smart contracts runtime possible. In many blockchain networks, one smart contract at a time influences and modifies the blockchain state. However, on Solana, the runtime can process tens of thousands of contracts in parallel. This allows for non-overlapping transactions to execute concurrently, and for transactions that are only reading the same state to execute concurrently as well.

Other pros of building on Solana are the max. transactions per second (59.490), the new creation of blocks every 400 milliseconds, and the low cost per transaction ($0.00001). A con, however, is that even though the Mainnet Beta version has been launched, most implementations are still waiting to be launched. Meaning, the network doesnâ€™t work as smoothly as advertised. This could be solved with updates in the future. Check the blog for news on updates and projects.
